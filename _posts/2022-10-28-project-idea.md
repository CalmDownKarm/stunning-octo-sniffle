I occasionally think of doing small ML things that are fun. Im hoping that by writing them down publically, it'll push me to actually making progress on some of them.

* Joe Rogan Stance Detection - Speech to text JRE episodes, topic model them and then do aspect based sentiment analysis/stance detection, build out a network graph of his and his guests views on certain topics as expressed in the podcast.
* Using Gpt3 to generate recipes, actually cooking them and making my friends eat them.
* solidity decompiler that leverages NMT and nucleus sampling to give nice/readable source.
* finetuning stable diffusion to automatically generate battlemaps for dnd.
* automatically generating ad-copy.
