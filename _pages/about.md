My name is Karmanya Aggarwal, I'm a machine learning researcher and engineer with a focus in productionizing NLP and an interest in Natural Language Generation.

I'm currently at the University of Pennsylvania for grad school and actively looking for opportunities starting May 2023.

The title of this websitecomes from my interest in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu - a martial art that I am quite horrible at, but enjoy immensely. As someone that's had a fairly chaotic life, I do believe that it's important to keep a steady eye on what's important, and to work towards improving at things that are important to you.
